			<article class="index"><h3 class="article">What exactly is SEO???</h3><br>
				<p class="article">SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is important for small businesses. It helps them be more visible online and attract more visitors to their sites. Good SEO improves a business's search engine rankings, making it easier for potential customers to find.<br><br>

					SEO involves making page content better, using relevant keywords, and improving overall site performance to show up higher in search results. Small businesses can reach more people and get more web page visitors by focusing on SEO.<br><br>
					
					Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo use complicated rules to decide which websites show up first. These rules look at things like how good the content is, how relevant the keywords are, and how easy the web page is to use.<br><br>
					
					For example, if a site updates its content often and uses keywords that match its business well, it can show up higher in search results. Businesses that spend time on SEO often see more people visiting their websites and more potential customers.<br><br>
					
					Because most people start their online experience with a search engine, having a good SEO plan is really important for small businesses to do well online.<br><br>
					
					In summary, SEO is a strong tool for small businesses to reach more people, get more web page visitors, and do better online. If businesses use good SEO strategies and keep up with what's new, they can be more visible and do even better online..</p></article>
